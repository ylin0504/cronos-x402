The Cronos x402 Paytech Hackathon invites builders from around the world to create the next generation of agentic, on-chain and AI-powered applications. This hackathon focuses on the emerging frontier of AI agents, x402-style programmatic payments and AI-native on-chain infrastructure enabled by Cronos EVM and the Crypto.com ecosystem.
Whether you're building agentic payment flows, AI-enhanced wallets, Crypto.com-integrated settlement tools, RWA rails, data virtualization layers, or new developer tooling for x402 agents, this is your chance to shape the future of AI-powered payments on-chain.
